Each player will have their turn to ask questions (Yes-No questions only).\n\nEvery player can see what words the other players have. Questions that are being asked can be answered by anyone playing.\n\nPlayer is only allowed to ask a question if itâ€™s their turn. Player is allowed to ask questions about their word until the answer to the most recent question is NO. If the answer is NO, the player has to pass their turn to the next player in line.\n\nPlayer is allowed to guess the word, but in failure to do so, the player has to pass their turn to another player in line.\n\nDuring each turn, the player has the ability to reveal their word by pressing a button. It should be pressed when the player guesses the word, but also when the player decides to give up or leave the game.\n\nThe game continues until there is only one player left to guess their word. The last player has to reveal itself and the game summary is displayed."
