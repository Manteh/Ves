VES is an in(ves)tigative party game that brings you and your family & friends together.

The purpose of the game is to try to guess a word that you were given by another player in the same room (e.g. your family member).

Every player has to think of a random word (e.g. Snake, Apple or King Kong) to give to another player that is randomly chosen to you.

After every player has received their words, the game will begin.
